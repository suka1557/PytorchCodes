he told me that he would go to france in june
i never should've broken up with mary
give me those
i'm calling because i've lost my credit card
a few minutes is all i ask
he did what his conscience dictated
why was i not aware of this
i was called into the office first my name being at the head of the list

why would i be jealous
tom rarely asks questions
where were you last night
he gets tired easily

do you want to go again
there will be a dance friday night at the high school
she shot a gun
the scenery is breathtaking
i heard a door slam
i heard that he passed the exam
there was not a tree in sight
have you ever seen an elephant fly
tom went to the movies every week
tom doesn't care what mary does or doesn't do
it has worked out nicely
if you don't do your duty people will look down on you
freedom is not free
it was rather difficult for me to make out what he was saying
you have many books
tom whispered something into mary's ear and she smiled
do you have any idea why someone would want to kill tom
tom hardly ever loses at chess
i love the sound of children laughing
whether you like it or not you'll have to do it
could you wrap them up separately
they live on the other side of the road
i feel safe with you

i can't wait any more
my room is twice as big as his
did he go home yesterday
tom can do it in  minutes
mary still plays with dolls
why are you mad at me
i took my revenge
i'm afraid you're sitting in the wrong seat
i didn't even see tom go
dolphins are playful animals
ask for more money
i should have listened more carefully
pay attention to me
you got better because you did everything the doctor asked
she may have argued with him but i don't think she could have hit him
the door blew shut
what have you learned
he added that he didn't believe it
tom was confused by mary's question
i was about to go to bed when the phone rang

they come from the same country
i am reading a magazine
what a wonderful present
what was the weather yesterday
maybe tom really did see mary kissing john
i have to help my mother
give tom what he asks for
i can't think of his name
faithfulness is a virtue
let's just say that i wasn't surprised
what made you decide to come here now
he stuck the broken pieces together
try on this sweater
i must clean the bathroom right away
tom and mary have never been close friends

your efforts are futile
i meant to look it up
i clicked the first link on the page

let me tell you something
he earns over  dollars a month at that job
one more hour and the turkey will be ready
i thought they offered you a job

i am never free on sundays
i have to ask you a question
tom asked mary to wait for him in front of the library
tom's name was on the box
eat and drink
how did you lose your arm
i think you did very well
he cleared the path of snow
are you serious
he added a little sugar and milk to his tea

tom admired mary for her courage
let's go in here and have a cup of coffee
tom isn't yet old enough to live alone
it was so cold my ears hurt
there's a fine line between genius and stupidity
you must have a reason for telling me
a rat is a small animal with long pointed teeth and a long tail
did you lose
tom signaled mary with a nod
i will check what time the train arrives
my watch is broken
no matter what you do tom will never agree
the man plucked up courage and pulled the trigger
it's so hot outside you could fry an egg
i'm leaving on sunday
this tie and that jacket go well together
this cake contains flour milk eggs and sugar
i know her
one plus two equals three
it's dangerous to swim in this lake
he doesn't even remember what happened last night
tom kept a squirrel as a pet
tom doesn't have to tell me i already know
it was ten degrees below zero this morning
why are you on this ship
this necklace is a family heirloom
he contracted an incurable disease
they're worried
this is terrible
why did you do this
you're a murderer
i'm poor
we had a pleasant evening
i want to say thank you
i do not and never will feed my dog raw fish
do you plan to go to tokyo by bus
wow that's cheap
it is said that her father was killed in a traffic accident
tom refused to sign his name
did you miss me
the story sounds true
there was hardly anyone in the room
tom slumped in his chair
my grandfather lived a long life
this table is a priceless antique
i'm going to get some grub and i'll be back
this noise is unbearable
i'm sorry tom i've got to go
what a hassle
some girls were playing tennis
you're something else
a lot of soldiers died here
does your father know
it was just a coincidence
something you should know about me is that i'm addicted to computer games
be polite but firm
tom was afraid he'd lost his key
i've only done this once before
they began to climb the hill
when was the last time you laughed
my wife cooks well
few students understand latin
tom and mary have both done that
you should take a vacation
the bus is capable of carrying thirty people
i see the crown
he likes singing
i felt guilty
the red lines on the map represent railways
the first thing you have to do is take a bath
tom left home ten years ago
it is a lot of fun to drive a car
tom is really good at math
the telephone is one of bell's many inventions
wow that looks delicious
your dog is still barking at me
i'm very disappointed
i'm e mailing to follow up on our phone conversation this morning
tom is very crafty isn't he
you were my friend
do it yourself by all means
is that your book
when the rain stops we'll go for a walk
children like playing outside
i bought it at a department store
how much food should i be feeding my dog
i am glad that you have succeeded
my father won't allow it
did you choose an interesting book for your son
how does he know that
tom seems to be unwilling to tell mary what happened
tom began to cry
they were so busy they didn't realize what time it was
what's happening to tom
let's check it later
i have to do that tomorrow
birds were singing up in the tree
we're the best
what is on the desk
my apartment is near here
earth is a beautiful planet
what time is it anyway
she is a nurse
the down jacket that i bought yesterday cost me a lot less than i had expected
i am quite comfortable in this room
i have to go back to work
the train was derailed
tom asked mary why she had done that
classes start at nine o'clock every day
it didn't break
i speak only the truth
i want one like that
who does she think that she is
my father doesn't waste his time
he's just arrived
what do you think of the new cabinet
do you know what time they came
she became a great artist
i want to be free
do you wear glasses
there is no water
the cause of the fire was unknown
are you a teacher or a student
i pretended that i didn't know tom
he knows how to play the piano
i need to get to work
he glanced from one to the other hoping for an answer
he received cheers and applause
i missed the train by a minute
i did it on my own
i don't feel like talking
he died of natural causes
that's fantastic
i wish i had more time to talk with her
needless to say health is more important than wealth
i have to buy a car this weekend
who's this message for
some people consider it a waste of time to study languages such as klingon interlingua and esperanto
what're you going to do during your summer vacation
tom wants to dance
how can i connect my ipod to a car stereo
a person like that would have no trouble getting elected president
i must talk to you
don't shut your eyes
i've received it too
don't make a mountain out of a molehill
tokyo is one of the biggest cities
i can't remember the meaning of the word that i looked up yesterday
tom is a talented actor
i'll go and get you a doctor
tom is naked
my house is near the station
they did not clap for us
i did all the work
this is one of the best places to eat in town
tom didn't have the courage to ask his boss for a raise
what's their purpose
we stored the hay in the barn
he can do it better than i can
in the us it is illegal to torture people in order to get information from them
we're not living together
slip on your shoes
i like doing stuff like that
most employees expect a pay raise once a year
look at tom's shoes
i guess i was wrong
he took a week off
my brother has been friendly to him
the train got into london
tom sat next to mary on the bus
the bird was covered with white feathers
the baby cried herself to sleep
how long ago did you start learning esperanto
i just don't want to make the wrong choice
tom gathered together all his belongings
you're not the only one who feels that way
tom has a lot of patience
it won't be long before we can start
in the beginning catalina had no more than two thousand soldiers
tom handed mary the scissors
winter is my favorite season
i think we can relax now
thank you for lending us the book
they already know
we know you
did i have a choice
i prefer the black one
tom put a flea collar on his dog
you may go there
you really are nuts
do you have a minute
he went to the airport to see her off
she is more clever than beautiful
i believe it will be snowing tomorrow
don't make a mistake
read whatever you like
we were shocked at the news of his death
i have a grenade
they cannot stop us
tom likes being alone
this is my book not yours
he read the book from cover to cover
the dog followed its master wagging its tail
i sent you an e mail
you're not the kind of girl that i usually go out with
this is tasteless
you're my friends
i don't have to study
do you know where my key is
tom unlocked his briefcase
keep me informed
i thought you said you were alone
i'll deliver it as soon as i can
this is going to be easy
not everybody is the same
she waited for you for two hours
i confessed
i wish they'd play this song over and over again
i appreciate how you feel
do not take any notice of him
i should sue tom
i should have taken the doctor's advice
set the alarm clock for seven o'clock
i'm absolutely furious
he actually hurt himself
exhausted from a day's work he went to bed much earlier than usual
that cost him his job
we ate a lot of ice cream
i don't know what it means
tom borrowed a book from mary
you should not waste your time
they say that eating more slowly is one way to eat less
opponents say genetically engineered crops can cross pollinate and damage other crops
i talked
it was hot yesterday
come to my house this afternoon
his death made everyone sad
he has adapted extremely well
tom didn't have anything to say
his life is in danger
we never talk about it
tom and mary are happy together
do you come here often
catch tom
where do you want it delivered
i'll try my luck
i think tom was speaking french
where will you be staying
tom promised mary he wouldn't tell john
i said i'd buy you a drink so here
he can swim well
try not to worry
we're coming
send him in
it's still too hard to find a job and even if you have a job chances are you're having a tougher time paying the rising costs of everything from groceries to gas
i'm getting married
i will finish reading the book in a week
i am afraid i must be going now
the photo was a hoax
we often hear you sing
tom hopes mary won't die
he admitted he had taken bribes
now it's time for the weather forecast
tom regrets having been rude to mary
tom walked on
light the candle
we abandoned the project because we didn't have enough money
tom didn't know it was already after 
like it or not you must do it
i'm your neighbor
tom was reunited with his father
i haven't paid this month's rent yet
tom saw mary and john holding hands
do you want to kill me
i love eggplant
he lives outside the city
we're going to the movies
i don't want to fail my exams
this patient's life is in danger
i made a bad mistake on the test
let me see that
do you think i'm kidding
all tom did was eat
who's your favorite song writer
my wife is a good cook
he licked his fingers
we got lost
you talk too much
if i didn't have money i wouldn't have a house
tom groaned
if i hadn't had your cooperation i couldn't have finished the work in time
tom probably got tired of waiting for mary and left
we want to do that but we can't
don't make me laugh
now she's gone mad
describe tom
i like your dog
delegates voted over and over again
i didn't know much about tom
tom knows many things
tom has no idea how to answer mary's questions
this key doesn't fit in the lock
god created the world
i know tom was unhappy
please let me help
i thought tom had already talked to mary about that
it's my fault
i just want to make sure this isn't poison
we often hear people say that time flies
tom made some mistakes on the test
i've got everything i want
he's at her side
you're aiming too low to hit the target
that cake looks good
mary is extremely beautiful
tom said he wants to show mary something
i have turned 
yesterday there was an earthquake
this may not be possible
this is something i have to do
you can't be a woman
have you tried doing that the way i suggested
tom is a schemer
do you believe in miracles
our fate is in your hands
i cannot answer so many questions at a time
what time do you usually return home
i'll allow this
let's not do something we'll regret
you've hurt tom's feelings
my friend is really a clown
i'd like you to come work for me
tom is responsible for this accident
i hate that song
i can't decide which car to buy
can you see the difference
tom forgot to tell mary that john had called
tom adores mary and follows her everywhere she goes
tom came to visit mary
are you honestly telling me you never want to see tom again
you mean you didn't tell him anything
i wasn't happy
i'm prepared
is there any room for me
the man stood up
should i clean my room
many people showed up for the party
boston is great
my son is taller than i am
call me when you're ready
he closely resembles his father
the lecture started on schedule
i am afraid of dogs
stop worrying
many dogs are alive
he is digging his own grave
drive carefully
i wanted to speak to you about this
what is the price of this watch
tom decided to delete his email address from every page on his website
tom was lured into a trap
tom won't go alone
tom's cat snuggled against his leg
i know whether or not he is an enemy
i thank you
this ticket lets two people in
the whole building was deserted
do you want some chocolate ice cream
money rules the world
i expect much of him
you should take a day off
sorry i must've dialed the wrong number
there wasn't a single book in the room
you're not young anymore
here use my key
my friends congratulated me on my success
i drink to relax
i fractured my arm
tell tom for me ok
about how much would a taxi be from here
tom is looking forward to seeing mary this coming weekend
i put up with her as long as i could
i know it's impossible
i will put off my departure if it rains
i just got up
is this all for real
tom can't tell a horse from a pony
i put the money into the safe
tom got up from his stool
she's thirty three
she advised him to stop drinking
tom is dating mary
his clothes always smell bad
he made a huge mistake
don't you like baseball
diligence is essential to success in life
tom won the bet
i've never liked tom
i need to help a friend in trouble
it's not mine
tom did it simply for the money
mary wore a white miniskirt
do you know how my friends describe me
everybody in the car said they wanted to get out and stretch their legs
don't tell my girlfriend
who wrote this
he looks strong
it's the perfect moment for a kiss

i don't want to offend tom
do you look your age
tom has three pens in his pocket
one hand washes the other
please do that
when i entered the room she was playing the piano
tom thinks he's being shadowed by a private detective
smoking will do you a lot of harm
i'm a bit busy
may i have a cup of tea
people who regularly work in the open air do not suffer from sleeplessness
i don't know what i want to do
nobody has ever done that
tell me when you’re going to leave
don't try to do two things at the same time
come up here
i'm not sure why tom is against the idea
i'm sorry to trouble you
i'm going to make you an offer that you can't refuse
all i know is that she left last week
leave me alone
i've never told anyone
i regret having said such a thing to my teacher
his father passed away last night in the hospital
he lied to me that is why i am angry with him
someone should tell tom
we gave our word
tom wasn't very good at reading between the lines
you seem to have a crush on tom
you are so stupid
i hate fighting
what do you do
i heard that tom wants a divorce

that's not possible
i thought tom had already done his homework
i don't want you seeing tom anymore
i outwitted him
tom is funnier than mary
i was only saying my prayers
why would anyone want to kill me
translate the passage word for word
there's a couple here
the structure isn't strong enough to support that much weight
i read the label
there are only two correct answers
the more i think about it the less i understand it
clearly i make you uncomfortable
i'm sure this is all a misunderstanding
i don't want you
tom has low blood pressure
there's no way i could do something like that in front of people
she accompanied me to the hospital
let me try again
i don't get the meaning of all of this
his hands were empty
did you leave the window open
these green leaves turn red or yellow in autumn
what makes you think tom is mary's boyfriend
you should give up smoking
did you get your wish
i'd like to reserve a seat on this train
can i speak to tom
i hate tom's parents
this room is too small for us
can i try it on
i hit my head hard against the wall
if you bite me i'll bite back
as i missed the train i had to wait for the next one for about an hour
do you know the meaning of this word
who's that woman standing over there
my stomach hurts
we must run
my sister washes her shoes every sunday
this county is poor in natural resources
no one's been here
i was in boston
tom likes to play soccer
i love you more than anyone else
he found a ball in the garden

i was aware of being watched
tom won't stay
i thought that you'd understand
she made him a cake for his party
tom wanted to make a snowman
tom made it on time
tom didn't feel like eating lunch
this game is easy
the cat has started acting strangely
he seems angry
yours is better than that one isn't it
tom sometimes picks his nose in public
i play video games
do you already have a plan
nuclear weapons are a threat to all humanity
they'll wait
you know something
i will not attend the party
could you bring me a pillow and blanket please
i think we'd better wait another thirty minutes
tom just got back from his lunch break
do that for me
it may have rained a little last night
don't get fat
she showed her guests how to eat what she had prepared
tom went to bed at midnight
please take care of yourself
i have the whole day free

i will never forget the day when i first met him

birds have wings
i dislike speaking in public
tom's room isn't very clean
it's a good question
would you please explain it more simply
all men are equal
tom considered the problem settled
thank you for coming to see me
tom wouldn't let me help mary
we learn by trial and error
i apologize for any problems that i may have caused
i was trying to distract her
she spends a lot of money when she goes abroad
it hasn't been easy for us to adapt
she tried in vain to conceal her fear
no thank you i am just looking
whether you like it or not the job has to be done
may i take your picture
would you like some more cake
tides are caused by the moon's gravity

there's a little wind
i couldn't control my tears
everything matters
here i am
i think tom will be happy to see you
i can't believe that you wouldn't enjoy playing cards with me and my friends
tom turned off the music
i didn't want you to know

i don't need you to remind me of anything i know what i'm supposed to do
i intend on fighting till the end
call tom immediately
if you don't kill them they'll kill you
the questionnaire form was distributed properly
i thought you were mad at me
his success delighted his parents
i'm not hungry at all
tom is estimating how much money he'll need to finish the house
you've done a very good job
tom wants to go to japan
tom doesn't know if it is true or not
do you know where it is
it's thanks to his father that he owns this hotel
tom was not much older than mary
lunch is at noon
well i have to be going
tell me about it
i found the film interesting
please try to be as brief as possible
i could kill you
nothing lasts forever
the girl wore a yellow ribbon in her hair
who taught you how to sail
we love you
tom wrung out the towel
tom can ski as well as his brother
i offered to lend money to her
where did you get that
i'm feeding the goldfish
i bought it at a department store
tom goes to bed at 
stand by
he is something of a celebrity
we'll have guests tomorrow
he lives alone
i am ready to follow you
there's an emergency
i'm an artist
i can get us out of this
let's stop hurting each other
i have two brothers and a sister
i have to tell tom something
the noise is getting louder and louder
who phoned
orange juice please
tell me why she is crying
if i had time to do that i would
i assume you know what to do
leave everything
you shouldn't trust your memory so much
tom never said no
here he is
he was waiting for a long time
i don't know what's going on there
i'm trying to meditate
tom is smiling at the baby
he looked much better this morning than yesterday
i loved reading when i was a child
i'm freezing
it can't be that he is busy
we're listening to celtic music
tom borrowed some money from mary
he isn't here now
the group is made up of six members
i'm being good to you this morning
the divers were trapped in the cave
i sometimes lie on the grass
you can't swim here
it is wrong to steal
look who's awake
keep away from the fire
he is a british citizen but lives in india
why do you want such an old car
i looked everywhere
let me be the judge of that
you should not despise a man because he is poor
tom had nothing to read
what is tom trying to say
the firemen localized the fire
what bit you
what don't you want us to see
tom plugged in the tv
mary put on too much perfume
humans were never meant to live forever
how do you account for that
i'm not used to working all night
tom should've kept his promises
i love the sound of her name
can you pass me the milk
don't you know that he passed away two years ago
it takes you an hour to go to the station on foot
he stood behind the chair
i think that someone went there
students may not enter the faculty lounge
tom decided to drop out of school and work full time
i don't want to insult tom
i am really glad to hear that you want to live in scotland
my father is home
we visited our father's grave
he shook my hand
tom showed mary the way
i've been to canada once
i just gave up
you're a bit taller than i am aren't you
i have to obey his orders
stop being so naive
dragons are cool
my cat rubbed her head against my shoulder
i'll be taking tom's place
you're great
are you bald
was anybody else hurt
do you know where my glasses are
please put this into english
the teacher accused tom of cheating
you're kind of cute when you're mad
my sister washes her shoes every sunday
i want to thank you again
tom is in bed
switzerland is a beautiful country
he kept reading the book
i share your idea
when he returned he brought a baseball cap and gave it as a present to his friend
he always works hard
i feel guilty about it
they must be punished
tom went to the library to study
i heard a beautiful song yesterday
i think this is enough
she said goodbye
tom saw a mouse
we slept under the stars
i've brought lunch
how old is that church
take a sweater with you so you don't catch a cold
tom looked as if he hadn't shaved for a week
i will never change my mind
that tall boy saved the drowning child
the baseball game was so exciting that everyone stayed until the very end
the old woman fell and could not get up
someone must've left the door open
i resign
tom knows the secretary of state
i would rather die than marry him
we could not swallow his story
take what you need
have you eaten yes i have
wash your hands
she went with him to the movies
tom is in poor health
the design itself is flawed
visitors are usually asked to remove their shoes before they enter a japanese house
anything you say may be used against you
the police didn't think it was likely that tom had killed himself
the young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen
how do i make you go away
tom isn't happy about what's happened
stop whining like a baby
elephants are the world's largest land animals
those apples are big
where is this guy going
tom cried all night
she filled her bag with apples
there is no turning back now
he drives a car doesn't he
let's help each other
that guy is off his rocker
i can't believe tom would gossip about mary like that
she lived there for many years
tom only has faint memories of his grandfather
hatred is our enemy
she is now on vacation
tom is good at singing
tom may be right
thank you for doing this
we need more
i've been married
i live in boston now
tom is very dangerous
do you have a dictionary
we're very pleased
everybody's still there
you're not sick
i don't know if i should tell him
tom is already on the list
this might not have anything to do with the problem at hand
everyone considers him to be honest
now i get it
i'm not rich enough to buy that
i slept all day yesterday
don't lie anymore ok
i don't even know how to dance
hold your position
who are you talking about
go home quickly
the only pear left on the tree is rotten
it's clear that he stole money from the safe
don't use the black pen
she is much younger than tom
he often plays guitar
health is worth more than gold
i hope that she'll get better soon
they made us work all night
my canary was killed by a cat
did you telephone him
it is a good camera
many mistakes could have been avoided through simple experiments
we're having a mild winter
i have feelings for you
he turned pale the instant he saw her
i never wear a jacket
whose car is that
the treaty bans atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs
this flower gives off a strong fragrance
this is the worst place in the world
let's take a break and drink some tea
both of them are busy
why is this room locked
they all stood up at the same time
tom should have told mary right away that he wasn't single
tom closed the door quietly and tiptoed into the room
that was an awful day
maybe we could get together sometime and have lunch
i am a citizen of the world
i have enough money to buy a car
i saw a boy crossing the street
where is the stop for the airport buses
you must be tired after a long day no not in the least
i'm sorry i won't do it ever again
i don't have to say a word
can we rent a rowboat
i made the woman angry
both cars involved in the accident were completely totaled
tom deserves to be promoted
they said that
tom and mary are at work now
tom is always online
my computer is my best friend
i have a lot of things to do
i didn't touch anything
look away
you can put it there
i had to resort to threats to get my money back
it doesn't sound true
mary ironed her skirt
you should do that soon
how are you going
i wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
it is hard for me to put my thoughts into words
i left the door open
tom wants us to know he did it
if we leave him he'll bleed to death
i don't know how to thank you
she held back her anger and smiled graciously
are you on facebook
how much did you pay for that
mary is tom's mother
we import raw materials and export the finished products
i started learning english six years ago
there's nothing inside
why do you say that
if you want security in your old age begin saving now
let me help
tom was a great neighbor
do you know the lyrics to this song
don't disturb me
tom is on a low fat high protein diet
you really have an ear for music
she isn't adequate to the task
tom can swim as fast as mary
i am in a new house
you have nothing to fear anymore
give me time
people said that he is insane
you've done it
how could you just walk out the door without saying goodbye
have you ever killed someone
it wasn't real love
there's no one in the room
i stayed with my uncle
we enjoyed the excursion very much
tell tom i won't be there
tom denied that he was the thief
i heard tom and mary talking about john
take this medicine before each meal
she advised him to lose weight
slavery was legal in the new republic of texas
we only have three hours
tom sneaked out the back door
they'll be fine
i am a student at london university
tom doesn't fear death
what did you learn at school today
thanks for the meal
i know the person you are talking about
tom and mary are very close to each other
there's a hole in this sock
i'll have a coffee and a croissant
the day will come when we can travel to the moon
i cannot read french
what are you going to do with my picture
i turned off the tv
one of them is lying
by the time i got to the station my train had already left
they are much taller than us
last month they had to lay off several hundred employees in the factory
where's the blanket
i don't know when my mother will come back
i wish i were young again
does anyone want some more pie
i'm against the war
i know the solution
the knife is dull
there was carnage
if you're going to doubt everything at least doubt your doubt
i'm still a little mad at you
i often wrote to her when i was a student
please don't cry
do you listen to the radio at home every day
climb onto the roof
it soon began to rain very hard
people shouldn't abuse animals
i've scolded him many times
there have been hitches
we both laughed
hokkaido is to the north of sendai
we complained to the manager about the noise next door
i had a good dream last night
are you older than tom
i've lost faith in you
learn to keep time
how long is he going to stay in japan
i just want to help fix the problem
have you solved all the problems yet
you can't change your username
the wind blew hard
please call in a doctor
the curry was nothing special
see you tomorrow in the library
you should make sure that you get there on time tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late
don't interrupt me while i'm talking
she turned the doorknob slowly
no thank you i'm just looking around
run or else you'll be late
the man was obsessed with fear that the secret might be disclosed
you have only three options
it's going to happen again
do you have something to write with
tom doesn't like coffee with sugar
mary resembles her mother in appearance but not in character
does tom know how to dance
keep your eyes closed until i tell you to open them
due to bad weather the plane was late
everybody here seems to know you
tom doesn't want to clean his room
tom turned off the tv
i'm going to cancel the meeting
i waited for her a long time
she suggested that i write to him at once
tom won't survive much longer
tom just packed up and left
she advised him to see a lawyer so he did
that might be true
you don't have to worry about tom anymore
he took charge of the arrangements for the party
tom is the one who shot mary
i'm pretty sure that my cat ate my hamster
we want to negotiate
she was crying in her room
what more can i do
i hope you aren't alone
i think tom is conceited
charge it to my account
i had a neighbor who was blind
i asked them to fix my car
if we hurry we'll make it
you despise tom don't you
i don't regret a thing
it's an error in judgment
i'm going to watch a scary movie
i'm not going to study french anymore
have you missed me
if you don't study harder you'll definitely fail
on my way here the strong wind blew my umbrella inside out
i had never been abroad before so everything seemed strange to me
tom said he doesn't eat meat
i've been expecting tom
she couldn't convince him to accept a personal check
i sell cars
tom never knew that
i will get in touch with you
i'll let you know as soon as i get there
i want to make a phone call but i don't have any change now
he is now either in rome or in paris
my sister saw it with her own eyes
can you dance
make your choice
can you pick it up
there is no excuse for the way tom acted at the party
how many guitars do you own
he can't have said such a stupid thing
tom is a good father
you made tom cry
the mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese
i think i drank too much
learning calligraphy is fun
he gave her a book
he got up to see if he had turned off the light in the kitchen
how did you figure out this problem
all students like holidays
i can see a ship in the distance
may the new year bring you happiness
come and join us
i'll pay for your lunch today
it glows in the dark
i'll drop you off at the station
no one stops to listen to him
a ceasefire was declared
you don't have to work so hard
i'm important
tom built his son a house next to his own
there's no harm done
he brought me back in his car
tom shot at mary but he missed
you were handsome
finish your work quickly
here's a list of people i want to invite to our wedding
i go to school at eight in the morning
it's a pain in the neck
she's also a beauty
what did you say to me
his name was on the tip of my tongue but i couldn't remember it
you should eat vegetables
i don't believe it
will she come home at five
what kind of sports we play depends on the weather and the season
i found these
tom always peels apples before he eats them
i love the flowers you sent me
could you repeat that again
he sometimes comes to see me
if i had had more time i would have written to you
i owe you a favor
please don't follow this advice
i gave tom your address
what do you hope to find here
she bought vegetables yesterday
what do you want to eat this weekend
i will visit nara next week
don't speak to him like that
i have something to give you
the dining car's at the front end of the train
everyone's watching tom
tom says he's feeling very tired
i have two cars
i hate to waste my time
tom showed the letter to me
this isn't french
tom stuck out like a sore thumb
we were all shaking from the bitter cold
be good
have you ever been on a helicopter
he stayed in his hotel most of the next day talking to friends and supporters
the main character is a man whose name we do not know
don't spill the soup
as soon as i find it i'll bring it over to your place
tom often talks with mary
there is absolutely no way that i would go on a trip alone
do you want to be my apprentice
the police were inquiring into the suspect's past
today is october th
the teenager insisted she was innocent of cheating
tom thinks he's in big trouble
he is a teacher rather than a writer
why aren't you here
i totally agree
tom knew the risks
what a relief
i didn't know tom had a cat
they bought a home with a pool
i went climbing in the alps
i even wrote a letter to tom
add sugar to the tea
tom is fun
we could make it on time if we walked a little faster
tom opened the windows to air out the room
you have the right to an attorney
i'm afraid it's going to rain
tom was born in 
that's obvious
what would you do if you saw a ghost
tom decided he needed a change
she trembled with fear
tom spent all day alone in his room
i like to travel by train
i also speak french
don't be shy
shouldn't you be listening
he kept calm in the face of the danger
does tom want to rest
above all things we must not be selfish
it took me more than one month to get over my cold
her dream is to become a nurse
don't mention our plan to anybody
you've let me down
tom is spraying his garden
whose room is this
i want a volunteer to help me
what do you think of this plan
why didn't anyone warn me
my cat came out of the basket
you say nessie is an imaginary being but i think she exists
she is always neatly dressed
she listens to religious music
the quarrel had unfortunate consequences
are you fond of listening to the radio
tom said he liked mary
don't be so noisy please
keep away from that
i spent twelve hours on the train
the twins look so much alike it's next to impossible to distinguish one from the other
i ran outside
how can you stand it
who were you expecting
how much longer do you plan to wait
tom didn't want to get out of bed
marika translated my book into german
he studies very hard
what teams were playing
go to your room now
how may i help you
i'm not here to help you
do you have a similar saying in japanese
this cake tastes like it has cheese in it
i think i'm going to faint
tom is a psychopath
i'm already ready
what do you want to eat
i promised not to tell him
i saw him come this way
he is known as a great painter
tom is banned from entering this building
write down your name here
you need a keycard to open the door
tom told mary that he was going to kill himself but he didn't have the courage to do it
i fed the dog
i hate when tom does that
you have provided me with some very useful advice
we don't have any sugar
what do you think happened to our family
it is hard to adapt this story for children
it is a secret
where are the goats
i don't like spiders
have you ever complained to the manager
i like this custom
tom spotted a pattern in the data
tom explained the system to mary
these are great
i want him to leave
let's leave it at that for now
she told her troubles to him
i got jealous
i asked tom to help me with my homework
have you ever been to new york yes i've been there a couple of times
i don't like this one
call the police
may we accompany you on your walk
thank you for giving me something to eat i was really hungry
my uncle lived a happy life and died a peaceful death
is a thousand yen enough
children are afraid of me
tom never wanted to see mary again
have you heard tom's music
i wonder who to invite
who are they cheering for
let me show you around the town this afternoon
he's afraid of cats
tom can barely walk
i asked tom to come
i'll sleep when i'm dead said tom
let me carry your bag
tom seems to believe everything mary says
women tend to live longer than men
when there's nothing left to do what do you do
what are you lining up for
let's get out of here
i don't know for certain yet
i have a brand new pair of socks
nothing seemed out of the ordinary
i like the color of this car
i've never done this in my life
i never knew my father
my grandfather nodded and smiled at me
where's this place
i think you'd remember that
the heat withered the flowers
only two texans were killed
they were all friends as children
i have no intention of apologizing
tom doesn't want to go out
i've been living in this house since last month
the tree's roots extend deep into the earth
summer has ended
there is nothing to fear
she became a singer
he rested his hand on my shoulder
tom helped us
i hope to see them
tom and mary are older than john
the rainfall was very heavy
don't touch it leave it as it is
please sit on this chair and wait
nobody believes what i say
she gave me good advice
tom screamed
he told me he wanted to quit the company
do you want to save them
the professor treated her as one of his students
yesterday was hot
there's something i need to talk with you about
he wasn't as handsome as she told me
i was impatient for the game to start
judging from how the sky looks we'll be having fine weather
you can't have your cake and eat it too
can you describe the object
she sat down and crossed her legs
he had been walking for hours
tom met mary
i took that picture a week ago
this picture must have been taken in 
the babies are screaming
where is the bus stop
did you grow up in boston
he was playing tennis all day
can you go faster
he regrets having neglected his studies in his school days
i think we do a really good job
his dog follows him wherever he goes
eating between meals is a bad habit
i went to your website
it isn't easy to write a love letter in english
tom is drawing something
thank you very much for your gift
tom is quite rich isn't he
i wouldn't do that without you
this dog eats almost anything
we need more sugar
tom told mary not to study so hard
she kept quiet
nice timing
i can't get along with the neighbors any more
i believe he is coming tomorrow
this might not be a genuine diamond
hit tom
i'd be very grateful if you'd help me
i assume that you've heard that we're having a meeting this afternoon
tell me how tom and mary met
i thought that you might be thirsty
she takes part in many school activities
isn't it beautiful
give the scraps to the dog
tom told mary a racist joke
when you arrive in osaka please contact me
everyone knows you're rich
it is raining now
i'm afraid that we won't be able to help you tomorrow
i don't want to hurt tom but i will if i have to
he added a little sugar to the coffee
tom's car was impounded
do you like your new job
it took him several weeks to recover from the shock
each person was given enough food and clothing
i've been waiting for you for three hours
i wish i had a good french dictionary
do you have a french dictionary
i'm angry
i thought that was your job
tom is a student too
do you have any tattoos
we waited for a long time but you didn't arrive
have they announced the court's decision yet
tom didn't know that mary was interested in classical music
to be honest i have a feeling this won't lead anywhere
the dog is theirs
the plane takes off in ten minutes
this ship is not fit for an ocean voyage
no one would blame you if you left right now
i want to learn to dance like you
i used to hang out with tom a lot but these days he's not around much
she is on a diet
he told me that he had lost his watch
how would you feel if your wife left you
are you tom's brother
we will never know how he's feeling
please do exactly as i say
did you call me up last night
watch this
i ate an apple
the ice melted
as far as i know he has never made such a mistake
this is a story of love and friendship
where does the airport bus leave from
i'm planning to disguise myself as a doctor
can i play your mandolin
she thought of a good plan
something came up
she has a white cat
tom loves coming here since he thinks this place serves the only fast food worth eating
this has nothing to do with tom
my husband is a compulsive gambler what can i do
i'm sure that tom won't be here this afternoon
how hungry are you
is it true that tom can't swim
tom took his girlfriend out on saturday night
don't you want to walk again
the dog barked
go on inside
how can you not remember
i went to that party
the water is clean
tom buys two or three cameras every year
i rested in the shade of a tree
you're the only one who volunteered to help
at last he reached his goal
he came home late last night
is it a boy or a girl
they're eating high on the hog
what are you doing on your night off
i wanted to help tom understand what mary was trying to tell him
who invented the telephone
i want to buy some dark glasses
i would never wear a hat that looked like that
he's a great coach and is loved by all his players
do you want to know what i think
millions of people lost all their savings
it takes time
i can't say that to my dad
the mouse ran into the hole
would you change your past if you could
in most cases car accidents result from lack of sleep
they've come back
what time shall i come
tom ignored all of mary's warnings
my mother boiled ten eggs
the floor was covered with dust
is spanish spoken in mexico
did tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend
can you read
are these cups porcelain
i can't tell you how to pronounce the word
are you embarrassed
you're mine
please reconsider
she will become a doctor
i thought you were raised in la
tom sure can play tennis
you will be able to speak fluent english in another few months
do you hear me
she teased him
which parent does the child resemble
do you accept visa
tom said that he'd rather not do that today
could you help me wash the dishes
i'll study hard tomorrow
hi i'm new here
keep in mind that smoking is not good for your health
my brother has joined the baseball club
tell me where you live
he asked about the others
to know oneself is not easy
my hands are shaking
tom hopes that mary will help him
she does whatever comes into her mind
it's time for dinner
the box contains some old jewelry
what's tom talking about now
click on the link
i'm very sorry to hear it
you are very brave
they are generous with their money
they began to kiss
they say he's very rich
it was a trap
thailand is in asia
i visit my grandparents twice a week

goodnight ladies
he did it for the good of the community
tom heard mary snoring in class
i want tom to win the election
i don't want to remember
i'll get there as soon as i can
how much does he pay for gas each month
he sold his own car without hesitation
tell tom i won't do that
i hate watching tv
tom has an evil twin brother
skating is one of my hobbies
it wasn't cheaper than any of the other stores
do you have a fever
i crawled out of bed and got dressed
she has a house by the sea
would you mind shutting the door no not at all
what an idiot
i argued with him about it
i'd like to marry a girl who likes to play video games
who'll start
she couldn't convince him to give a speech
we want it to be a surprise
tom chased the cats out of his house
i need an answer
how much is an apple
what's that for
you can't park here
the girl hugged her doll
something must've happened
money isn't everything
my grandson is still a baby
no one is listening to me

it may be impossible to get a completely error free corpus due to the nature of this kind of collaborative effort however if we encourage members to contribute sentences in their own languages rather than experiment in languages they are learning we might be able to minimize errors

it is something my mother made
she can count from one to ten
we cannot tell a good person from a bad one by looks alone

why did he have to wait for you for so long
i was following orders
i asked him point blank
tom has a talent for acting

to make a long story short he married his first love
do you love him too
i'm going to boston for the holidays
his heart beated slowly
tom would rather stay
tom needs to know the truth

tom could swim a lot faster when he was young
i've decided to quit my job at the end of this month
the news of the accident caused public alarm
i know what i'll do

nobody will be able to stop tom from doing that
when i was younger i thought i could do anything
i apologize if i hurt your feelings

it took a long time but in the end i was able to convince him
why did you stay at home yesterday
we're listening
tom doesn't like being treated like a child
he learns fast

i was in the hospital last week
tom waited on the platform
she's a bit naive
tom said he's canadian
the three of them all just looked at tom
it would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains
there used to be a big pine tree in front of my house
i think you're lying
he came five minutes after the bell had rung
he has all but finished the work
that sounds like a job for tom
ask tom not to wait for me
these small letters can only be read with a magnifying glass
i'll go do that
i beg you to let me live
the trouble is that i am short of money these days
i have two sisters both of whom are married
stay and have a drink with us
no one is allowed to go there
you deal with it
life is like riding a bicycle to keep your balance you must keep moving
you're not me
i went straight to bed
don't risk your neck over something foolish
this is the book i want to buy
you don't have to go unless you want to
the curtain caught fire
there are some red lights blinking on the console
tom told me that i shouldn't buy that
what's your story
i felt as if my face were on fire
my name's tom
tom pretty much forgot about the meeting
don't leave the tv on
i wonder whether tom could help us
he was laughed at in public
i can recognize him even in a crowd
we wear uniforms at our school
it looks like i'm not needed here
this fruit has a bad taste
just listening to that song makes me think of you
please bring this gentleman a glass of beer
tom went to a wedding last weekend
stay out of tom's room
i'd like to leave a message for tom
it doesn't really make much sense does it
smart people can pretend to be dumb the opposite is more difficult
is this a river
the doctor said that i would have to quit smoking
tom is the black sheep of the family
you should come out with us
how much do you want to spend
tom overpowered mary
i need to know why you need this
would you like to eat with us
it can be confusing at first
tom heard that mary was very rich
why are you asking me this
it can't be helped
tomorrow will be even warmer than today
we have an hour's recess for lunch from twelve to one
i fear no one
here is her letter asking us to take care of her only son
tom doesn't want to miss his flight
he wanted my permission to use the telephone
are you going to the gym today
the monkey climbed up the tree
tom is the perfect father
he kept walking back and forth
tom picked up the coins that had fallen behind the sofa
this medicine tastes bitter
are you sure of your answer
i'm getting used to this weather
excuse me where is the train station
there's a monster under my bed
the first phase of construction has been completed
i think it's doable

i can't make promises
would you mind waiting here just a moment
the only one who has a problem with this is you
i don't know what to do for dinner
i have to drive this car
are you going
tom told mary why she shouldn't go out with john
i'll tell you what that means
the snow lasted for two days
you're losing me
she reads nothing but fiction
i think that's a hoax
the teacher pointed to the blackboard
school begins in april
he comes here every three days
why don't you just shut up
tom came
we need your key
do you really want to quit school
i don't feel like laughing
this is room 
tom wondered what mary was doing here
it's junk throw it away
they're very poor
i'm in the tennis club
what a great idea
what a beautiful day
i don't know how i could've been so blind
tom rinsed off the soap
the battle quickly became fierce and bloody
you can trust us
we'll help
my father does not go to tokyo today
they work together
trash belongs in the trash
a painter's eyes are his most important tools
is tom aware of what mary did
tom lost his voice
let me pay tonight
he's stupid and dishonest
if you can't come we'll understand
i don't want to go
tom bought a camera just a couple of days ago but he's already lost it
no doubt she will come soon
i don't want to help you
rural environments are too quiet for me
i heard that both of your grandfathers were plumbers
do you know where tom was hiding
it was a significant moment
she advised him to get more exercise
the fog was so thick that i couldn't see where i was going
i need to go eat something
the most interesting information comes from children for they tell all they know and then stop
my father was lost in thought
does this letter have to be written in english
we saw a bird in the distance
neither side is without blame
what bothers me is his attitude
tom dealt the cards
tom was not able to quit smoking
you reap what you sow
tom doesn't want to be a hero
he pretended not to be listening
she's a single mother of two
a rainbow is a natural phenomenon
every action has its consequence
this flower smells nice
we're making progress
we had a nice time last night
he showed me how to use this camera
tom can understand mary's french
the doors on the left side will open
my mother divided the cake into eight pieces
he likes listening to the radio
i ordered new furniture
do you think doing that is going to be easy
tom stuck out like a sore thumb
we can't give up now
the only reason tom went to the party was that he expected mary to be there
what's she doing
i looked for the key under the welcome mat and in the nearby flower pot
tom is the perfect son
i have two brothers and one sister
tom eventually retired
i am studying english now
tom walked silently through the forest
he fell in love with his best friend
do snakes bother you
did tom help his mother yesterday
who would be stupid enough to do that
keep them
excuse me i have a question
tom doesn't like not being able to control mary
you look nice with your hair short
by the time you come back i'll be gone
tom made stew for dinner
that won't happen
you're a very handsome young man
the door closed with a bang
i was always honest with you but you never tried to be honest with me
i'm happy to see you
the dog is biting tom
he's the one who told me about that
you promised not to do that anymore
france is in western europe
let's party
your new dress is very pretty
each one of us was given three hundred dollars
the police wanted to avoid bloodshed
this will be a good souvenir of my trip around the united states
look here
did you already do your homework
i couldn't get tom to wake up
this box weighs three kilograms
everything he says is correct
don't you feel the house shaking
tom glared at mary with hatred and disgust
do you eat fish
i take it for granted that she will join us
get lost
we want to know what happened to tom
we can help tom
this is what we want to know
i'm leaving for australia tomorrow
father always says do your best
there is no shame in admitting one's faults
let's not deal with that problem right now
tom reluctantly accepted the gift
he complained that the soup was too hot
tom doesn't like being cooped up in his small office every day
how did tom get in here he came in through the window that you left unlocked
they gave up
tom caught up with mary and john
i've been thinking a lot about tom lately
today's your lucky day
tom swims better than i do
he came here ten minutes ago
i fell asleep in the middle of the lecture
how did you get up there
i thought you said you didn't see anything
i don't know what to depend on
you've got to be kidding
running as fast as i could i was able to catch up with my friend
last night we attended a classical music concert
do you know the difference between a microscope and a telescope
i have gained weight
i don't know what tom will say
i can't believe i let tom do that
that would be dumb
we've got plenty
where's everyone
my fingers left marks on the glass
tom keeps a diary
tom is making progress
this shop belongs to me

my father is so old that he is hard of hearing
most children like to jump rope
how hungry are you

tom did just that
there's a big storm coming
we're looking into that

i have an interest in cello and piano
they never listen to me

i wish i were a good singer
i can't help loving her
the capital city of france is paris

i go out sometimes for a beer
do you have any grounds for thinking so
how deep are the cuts
maybe it wasn't tom
i've got a frog in my throat
can i ask your advice on something
i couldn't believe what i was seeing
tom cried himself to sleep
i will do everything in my power
he doesn't eat raw fish
we've got a deal
it's easy for monkeys to climb trees
who plays the keyboards in your band
i would rather stay home than go out
she said nothing that would make him angry
this is top secret
you're the only person i know besides myself who likes to do that
i miss my parents
mary is the woman of my dreams
i thought you were a friend
tom wants to know how he can lose weight quickly
we have till tomorrow night to decide

this coffee is too hot for me to drink
i no longer have the energy to talk
the plane crashed against the house
tom speaks french better than mary
where did the accident take place
tom should be at home
i made my decision
the police thought the victim was tom but they were unable to identify the body
did you hear someone ring the doorbell
tom is in the bathroom
today is one of my friends' birthday
i'm pretty blind
we left by train
tom chose the restaurant where we ate lunch
tom had white shoes on
why don't we go in
i'm not sure why
i'm so tired that i can't walk any longer
competition is not bad in itself
i wasn't asking you
she got angry
sorry to be late
see for yourself
we're better
get a ticket for me
i have a message for you from your father
it wasn't tom who kissed mary
scores of people gathered in front of the royal palace
why are you following me
nobody likes you
i had to compete with him for promotion

i have a vague recollection
your time will come
do you have any idea what my life is like
i walk in the forest every day
according to a recent study the average life span of the japanese is still increasing
she kept me waiting for half an hour
tom fooled mary
we have yet to learn the truth
tom says we can park on either side of the street
i didn't want to do it like that
the food wasn't that great
tom and mary went to the same school
he was foolish enough to believe her
we felt the house shake a little
can we please go home now
i do not want any milk at all
tom is going to see mary today
tom ate alone
am i disturbing you
why are you so awful
she advised him to take the medicine
both men opposed the war in vietnam
i think it works
the bigger man often wins
can you produce any evidence that he was not at home that night
money is power
the king abused his power
i like to go swimming in the sea
who's tom talking to
when i woke up it was snowing
eventually tom will realize that he needs help
i wish you had been there
i bought a nintendo ds
we don't even know each other
we'll fail
what does tom get in return for all the work he's done
almost no one knows we are sisters
she called him to say that she'd be late
we're going to have a test today
we got lost in the snow
that child learned to tell good from bad

i wish you spoke french
tom is always blaming himself
were you talking about me
you should go to sleep
he was curious about how it would taste so he took a small bite
she sat next him with her eyes closed
the shotgun went off

i can't imagine life on another planet
i wouldn't bet against tom
he came back after dark
i also want to see the ocean
tom doesn't understand the value of saving

you're depressing me
tom doesn't know whether it's true or not
if you wish for peace prepare for war

i hugged her tightly
he spent the morning reading a book
did i win
we lost sight of him

i know nothing about music
you may return
why do you want to work here
tom is changing his clothes
the water became muddy because of the rain
stop and think it over for a minute
i'm very tired today
i like your way of smiling
the people are so friendly
we are collecting sentences and their translations into other languages
i don't know what to do
we hid behind a bush so that no one would see us
tom is the only witness to the crime
she proudly displayed her jewels
may i introduce myself to you
tom handed mary a cup of coffee
the deer was running by itself
put on your hat
at last the bus stopped
she was hurt to find that nobody took any notice of her
have you ever felt dizzy on a plane
who broke the window

what tom really wanted was some peace and quiet
don't let your imagination run wild
she choked him
you're either with us or against us
do you talk to your plants
she took care of his wound
the question still remains why tom would want to do that
tired from the hard work he went to bed earlier than usual
the power went out
get some rest
you may choose whichever book you like

i guess i'll have to think it over
maybe i can help you
may i begin by thanking every one for your warm welcome
tom has passed out
this is intolerable
it took me more than a month to get over my cold
there's something i should tell you

john kept his head above the water
tom retired from the company in 
she likes tigers
there are many old temples in kyoto

what do you do with your clothes when they are worn out
look at this picture of my family
i carried the box on my shoulder
he looks as if he could not even harm a fly
tom is the one who broke the window yesterday
i love to dance
both his parents are dead
tom is not yet able to swim
i outrank you

i'll try to distract them
tom has a better idea
tom waited for what seemed like a long time
boston is my home
tell tom we're here
tom is a good boy
man is the only animal that talks
will you play tennis with us
a baseball came flying through the window
even if you go far away let's keep in touch with each other over the phone
she was admitted to the club
he is fed up with my problems
unless you study you won't learn this
i would like you to make tea for me
she was cooking dinner at that time

i never learned to swim
i am sending you a birthday present by air mail
you're motivated

tom had long hair last year
tom'll remember
i'm getting too old for this
i assume that tom doesn't have that many friends
that man was born lucky
tom stifled a scream
don't be discouraged just because you're not all that talented
we were talking
isn't it pathetic
is it a yes or a no
her grey hair makes her look older than she is
i sold my books at a reasonable price
would you like to come and see us this evening
yesterday i was caught in a shower on my way home from school
wipe that smirk off your face
i love snow
tom seems nice
everything tom does is controversial
he always sings while taking a shower
tom received a heavy blow on the head
don't look back
tom doesn't know what he'd do without mary
he is usually straightforward and sincere and thereby gains the confidence of those who meet him
they smell bad
tom ran to catch the train
i was very tired so i went to bed early
what'll actually happen is anyone's guess
you got here late didn't you
i was afraid that you had failed
what's your mother's name

i asked tom to tell me what he wanted
how many sisters does tom have

his memory never ceases to astonish me
he claims he knows nothing about her
when he was faced with the evidence he had to admit that he was guilty
i've never heard him speak ill of others
tom attracted a crowd of children as soon as he started playing his bongos
could you write that down please
i'm actually very happy
she's open minded

tom knows something that he's not telling us
tom had a car accident in rome
i always drive at a moderate speed
i've never been to paris
tom couldn't answer even one question on yesterday's test
he turned the bottle upside down and shook it but still the honey wouldn't come out
we got off on the wrong foot
this battery is charged
i said is there anything i can do
i owe you an apology
excuse me but who are you
i was talking to tom the other day
the band played dixie

it must've cost a fortune
i just want to hear you sing one more time
the train leaves at six
he's a genuine aristocrat

by the time you came back i'd already left
the baby is still sleeping
keep your hands off my daughter
i filled in my name on the paper
year after year production continued to increase
isn't it remarkable
it's already eleven
how many mosques are there in istanbul
she got him into trouble
is that the woman who knows the answer
you're the best dad ever
i bought this sweater yesterday
get your things
what does it involve
you should've started with simpler questions
you'll understand it right away
life is short
we have a kanji dictation test today
people can easily tell the difference between them
tom jumped out of bed
who would send me flowers
he came to see you right after you left
the man entered the next room
how about a drink
it's very dry
his doctor advised him to give up smoking
i feel happiest when i am at home with my family
it won't be easy
one hour of thoughtlessness can cause years of tears
does everybody want it
what time does school begin
i can't believe you're taking pictures of cockroaches
tom filled the bucket with cold water
there were almost no cars in the parking lot
that's my real name
i'm going back to boston i've had enough of chicago
i was compelled to go there
i didn't know we had one
my aunt goes to germany every year
you can probably guess what happens though
life ain't easy
you put far too much pepper in it
she stood up to answer the phone
tom abstained from voting
i am deeply indebted to my friends for all their help
it was exciting
she has green eyes
i'm not here to help you
i wish that more people could be like you
the curtains are closed
it's difficult to help people that don't want your help
be confident
tomorrow i'm going to study at the library
i aimed my gun at the target
don't open the door for anybody
i need a ladder so i can get up to my roof
it doesn't surprise me
i want to be in the other group
she spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner
she has long hair
does he go to school by bus
i haven't played the ukulele in years
you're too young to marry
this party is great
when the police arrived the thieves had disappeared
i didn't have lunch today
tom bought a very expensive camera
i can lend you some money if you need some
the fender was badly dented
tom hid under the bed
it really isn't that bad
was it fun
something is terribly wrong
he has strange ideas
you swim well don't you
i just need some sleep
tom was on the fence
since i'm not so good at swimming i avoid swimming in water that's over my head
he made his way through the crowd
i came here to see if there was something i could do to help but there doesn't seem to be anything for me to do
the victory is ours
tom asked mary why john was so unhappy
her mother became mad at us
they set fire to houses and farm buildings
it's illegal to park your car here
did you feed the dog this morning
i go to bed early
tom has to learn to be more careful
the road turns left there
tom has gone crazy
never did i expect to see her in such a place
you need to take better care of yourself
are you eating lunch
don't lean on my chair
be calm
i picked up some french
so long
we got lost in the fog
i'm getting a big raise
my sister is a twenty one years old college student
what did the doctor say
some boys came into the classroom
they were very happy
pay what you can
you can put your name on a name tag
if there's anything at all that you don't understand you can ask me anytime
he asked for the money
she attempted to kill herself
police caught the criminals
a cookie is under the table
how do you like your eggs done
write your address here
i'll give you a prescription
prior to your arrival he left for london
do you know when tom's birthday is
he could no longer stand the pain
i'd like to know why you did it
tom wanted to meet you
she's busy
everything he sees arouses his curiosity
the trial will continue monday
tom wasn't totally surprised
run or else you'll be late
many of them carried guns
he would not follow my advice
tom didn't want to get involved in the fight but he had no choice
excuse me but you're mistaken
many young men went to war
tom won't get in
tom decided not to tell mary about what john had done
you should be ashamed of your stupidity
tom doesn't want to argue with you
tom is an effective salesman
it's difficult to understand his ideas
give me just a little
please stop changing channels
tom needs a favor
she rarely sings but i think she will tonight
his family are all very well
he seemed disappointed at the results
what took you so long
this task is too much for him
i wonder how sausage is made
the patient's in the hospital
they'll attack
balls are round
i have no words to express my gratitude
tom pretended he didn't understand what mary wanted him to do
let's all try to get along
tom cleaned his room last weekend
tom couldn't remember the name of the place where he met mary
tom believes the day will come when there will be no more wars
i don't need tom
she's stubborn
this is your key
tom'll go
he can speak just a little english
i didn't buy anything
i don't want to do that anymore
excuse me but could you scoot over a little bit please
soldiers must obey their commanders
i told you i didn't want to do this
tom's useless
the girls danced in the gym
i didn't think you'd like doing that
how long have you been standing here
the girl had a large red hat on
he is better than me at math
i heard the bell ring
he died from overwork
this wine is extremely delicious
could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days
everybody loves him
dogs can't distinguish between colors
he plays cello exceptionally well
he seemed to have just woken up from a dream
she is not here
come closer
she began to sing
tom stopped speaking
tom ended up marrying mary after all
this summer we'll go to the mountains and to the sea
i'm going to call tom right now
tom was the one who cooked dinner
put on a robe
your hand is as cold as ice
this is pretty bad
tom is an evangelist
you hypocrite
she's not his sister but his mother
where did tom go wrong
what are my chances of surviving
he's very generous so let's go with him
we're nearly finished
it'll probably rain this afternoon
i will tell the woman what i know
all hands abandon ship
can i borrow this umbrella
do you want our help or don't you
i'm aware of what is at stake
i have to stop you from doing that stop me from doing what
eating habits differ from country to country
you're a good role model tom
i think i see the problem
forgive us
hang on
i hope to retire from work when i'm  years old
her english is perfect
where can we go
i think it's impossible for tom
i am his friend and will remain so
i want to kill somebody
tom has started making mistakes
to tell the truth this is how it happened
did you hear about the big earthquake in japan
tom is clearly hiding something
he knows how to drive a truck
why are you doing this
tom explained everything to mary
we heard the bomb go off
he has been working on a new book for two months
even the mayor breathes dioxin
disconnect the plug
that effort bore no fruit
that kid was almost run over when the truck backed up
i think it is a mere coincidence
are you still sleepy
the sun is setting
i don't know why you don't like him
do you think animals have a soul
does money bring happiness
he was exiled to an island for the crime of high treason
we are looking forward to seeing you
oil may not last for another hundred years
mom where's the cat
as soon as tom got mary alone he told her the bad news
that was my big mistake
the man is starving
when did it stop raining
the stain disappeared after we washed the shirt
are you sure you want to do that
is french pronunciation difficult
did you just call me an old grouch
he was born dumb
you must do it yourself
the football game is now being broadcast
i've wanted to be a painter for a long time
that is the bus stop
i want to eat something
can i do that
what seems simple to you seems complex to me
you were nice
let's pretend we're happy together
he served as mayor
they're unreliable
this is boring
i got my ears pierced
not everyone is like you
this is a song i learned when i was a child

i want to keep my car there
tom is available
michael jackson has died
unless tom is sober i don't want him helping us
they're back

i ate it all by myself
the rain hasn't stopped yet has it
i want you to lay back and relax
creationism is a pseudo science
you have to obey your parents
the fire fighters put out the fire
i'm sorry i called you a liar
hold still
violence is the cancer of our society
part of the story is true
there is a large hole in the wall
tom seems bored
she's probably ashamed of her apartment
she knows who we are
the bill please
i heard the bell
i think he'll never return
can you do it in one day
honey will you go shopping for me
they're boys
when does it start
the hunter followed the bear's tracks
i need to go and buy some stamps
she had no way to know about it
you stole my idea
you smell good
i am badly in need of your help
may i speak with the teacher
i thought you didn't want to come
get out of my bed
it was nearly noon
maybe it will be exactly the same for him
a young man is singing in front of the door
she is not a nurse but a doctor
he is ashamed to ask questions
just put yourself in my shoes
tom isn't the sharpest tool in the shed
everything tom said about mary was true
i didn't hear what tom was saying
that's why i told you not to go by car
prizes will be awarded at the end of the contest
i'm your sister

tom and mary eventually broke up
there's someone here
it's amusing
there are few alternatives
tom told mary about john
i don't know what tom knows but tom knows what i know
do all the exercises at the end of the chapter
tom doesn't care what happens
i was forced to abandon the plan
which one of you wasn't on the bus
my parents are english but they came to brazil in 
i tried to put an end to the quarrel
it is said that time heals all the wounds
if i had taken that plane i would be dead now
the old woman got off the bus
the train has just gone
i began to sweat
tom knew that mary was throwing a party
he doesn't know what to do with his money
he took a picture of the koala
tom could have paid for mary's ticket if he'd known she didn't have enough money
please be polite
i'm very glad to see you
we're wasting precious time
those are values that we all share
the top of that mountain is flat
i'm shy
tom didn't do it
i still have the book from last semester
i don't know you anymore
thank you for your invitation
she tasted the cake to see if it was sweet enough
tom and mary are longtime residents of boston
time flies
that's his private website
not being tall isn't a disadvantage
i'm thinking about something else
why does everybody hate me
a girl gave me an orange in exchange for a piece of cake
i will start working on july the first
who are my new neighbors
we have a crisis
tom can go hear mary sing at that club whenever he wants to
she is not in the least surprised
i want to meet with tom
why don't you ask tom yourself
we went down a river by canoe
don't forget there are exceptions
he was caught stealing apples
would you care for some more cake
stop you're making me blush
this is the magazine i spoke to you about
she baked her husband an apple pie
he generally goes home at five o'clock
i'll miss you when you're gone
why does tom hate mary
he likes walking in the park
i even wrote a speech just in case i was asked to give one
i think we should notify tom's parents
there's no rush
everybody will be home for christmas
you were exaggerating weren't you
i am going to try to get a good tan
i remember seeing you last year
there are more clouds today than yesterday
he instructed me to go to bed early
please call a taxi for this lady
we were afraid that we might hurt his feelings
i don't have a choice

i ate the meat
it was night
i want to send tom a letter

i've always played with my brother
japan today is not what it was even ten years ago
i talked on the telephone
his english is not bad seeing that he has studied for only two years
i would rather throw the money away than give it to him
tom didn't go out last weekend
no matter how hard she tried she couldn't please him
the climate here is very mild so it seldom snows here even in the winter
may i use your car dad
this is just what i wanted
he is watching tv now
i'm sure i have the right number
sleep tight
my mother set the table
you are big
she received the electricity bill today
we have no sugar
it's not that cold
he does not study hard enough
the team won the semifinals and advanced to the finals
these socks are a bargain
as a rule the game of life is worth playing
it doesn't make sense to criticize someone for doing something that we would do if we were in their situation
even if i wanted to i couldn't do that
add more water to it
you can do whatever you want to do of course
taste this wine to see if you like it
you don't need my help
you are too young to travel alone
tom would never break a promise
you'd better not see her now
i will try next week

i wish i could do that

i'll teach you how to drive a car
where do you live i live in tokyo
that tie goes well with your shirt
look both ways before you cross the road
i had a suspicion that he would leave me
he appeared young
when will it be convenient for you
i won't say a word
this is wrong
daddy loves to say funny things
i'm sure that was helpful

i had a weird dream last night
i could kill you

he never fails to write to her every week
i smell something awful
we are sorry for the inconvenience

as far as i know the novel is not translated into japanese
i don't want tom and mary to see me cry

why aren't you wearing your wedding ring
now that you've decided to quit your job you look happy
i meant to call her but i forgot to
if i'd only taken your advice

i say it's worth a try
tom has much more experience than mary does
he is my father
let's stop here
is it happening right now
if i were you i wouldn't have done that
your answer differs from mine
tom asked mary not to wake him up before seven

please be gentle
i found the book very interesting
i thought you had lost your watch
she had a healthy baby

these lenses aren't scratchproof
i wonder how much time we will have to do that
hey you're not tom
tom has since apologized
where is the nearest subway station
i have a dictionary in my hand
he crept out of the room very carefully to avoid waking her up
be careful what you wish for
it's all for the best
i know that tom wants to get married
everyone hesitated
i thought tom would give mary your phone number
sorry i couldn't help it

we were very sad

it's dangerous to play around the fire
tom will find me
i don't want to die here

he entered the university after failing the examination twice
i'm completely confused
he is the dumbest kid in the class
tom said he didn't want to study french
stay here with us
for three weeks he ate nothing at all
tom picked up a stone and threw it at mary
this might just work
the police were hoping that tom could shed some light on the incident

i couldn't help but laugh

this morning i left for school without washing my face
that took longer than i expected
the water's leaking from the elbow of the pipe
he looked up at the sky
what tom said made you angry didn't it
she isn't good enough for him
the train arrived ten minutes behind time
i didn't see anything unusual
please fill the bucket up with sand
i would go to the movies if i had the time

i'm convinced tom is innocent
we'll have a great time

i bought a glass vase
is there some reason you don't want us to come
tom forgot who said it
i will give you a call as soon as i know for sure
it looks appetizing
should i close
tom has never trusted me
tom always wanted to visit mary but he never had the chance
some people are for the plan and others are against it
blow the horn so that car will let us pass
this problem is too difficult for me to solve
tom hated to bother mary so late at night but it was an emergency
you're fired

there's nothing left
i know it's not possible
i thought it might be of some use
i haven't seen you for a long time come and see me once in a while
there's nothing harder than a diamond

it's the best season of the year
tom should've hired a better lawyer
why are you all here
i think it's time for me to buy my son a car
i asked him why he was sad
he is likely to win the game
she can't live without him
the girls won

he appeared thinner every day
it's time for us to talk
he's doing his best
he read the book from cover to cover
after breakfast we went out for a walk
that car is very new

tom isn't the best person for the job
you can make your own
i laughed so much my stomach hurts
tom joined us
mary hired tom to paint her house
this book is for you
judging from the look of the sky we may have snow tomorrow
i gave some water to the dogs
tom wanted mary to stay a little bit longer
how do i get my dog to eat dog food
horses are different from donkeys
she couldn't have expected that he would come home when everything was over
i got left behind
black and white photos have a special charm
stop dreaming
to me it's important
tom got angry when he saw mary with john
we depend on you
i came for you
tom thinks that mary and i can't take care of ourselves
most young people don't know the terror of war
i just don't love tom
these apples look very fresh

we had to wait until she found a chair and sat down
i can't even look at you
he's always saying bad things about his wife
i don't feel like celebrating
i might vote for tom
tom showed mary something
tom is focused
there isn't much butter left in the refrigerator
i finally gave up smoking
he's almost as tall as me
farther on we came upon a house
let's get off the bus

tell tom i'm not interested in the car he's trying to sell
we didn't break up
he eats around the clock
i'd like you to read this book
i've done everything you asked me to
what you did was dishonest
this apple is very red
i didn't see the sign

i remember your face but i don't remember your name
a terrible fate awaited him
i think that you ought to apologize to her
i hate to contradict you
tom has long hair and wears glasses
i like to talk
if you leave now i'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam

when you can't do what you want you do what you can
i can't talk now
he reads the newspaper every morning
do tom and mary know
when tom put his foot into the stream he felt something bite his toe

she felt so humiliated that she couldn't say anything
don't take it seriously
i'll show you my room
i can't put up with her any longer
it's so difficult that i've decided to give up trying
do you have a twin sister
you cannot live by love alone
our guests are arriving
are you seriously thinking about getting involved
i'm sure that wasn't intentional
they spoke too quickly for me to understand

tom doesn't look so good
don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam
i can't eat
the moon is very beautiful this evening
i didn't ask for it

he refused to take the bribe
it would be crazy to climb that mountain in the winter
he called us at the top of his lungs
she's asking for the impossible
i know that she doesn't know who i am
he's always complaining
i'm going up to the bar for a drink and i suggest you do the same

tom brought mary to the station
i know what happened to tom
the moon is shining brightly
tom and mary bought a house in boston last year
they're inside
i had a great time with you today
it seems that there is no way out of our difficulty
he put his room in order
did you really do that
tom loves studying music
what's that building
i had to help tom
my family is not that large
keep dancing
he was kind enough to tie my shoelaces
the glass got broken
she didn't have much difficulty finding out the answer to the problem
i took painkillers and kept working
i knew that was tom
you must hurry up
it went well
it worked
the ceremony was impressive
i'm sorry but it's just not possible
tom didn't want to do it
tom is ready to resort to violence in order to get what he wants
do you want to kiss me

he went to the shop
tom climbed out the window
if you go fishing tomorrow i'll go too
i have to say goodbye to some friends
seattle has a very wet climate
tom is desperate
as soon as he opened the door he smelled something burning
tom asked me where mary lived
i am surprised to see you here in this hotel
i'll be with you in a second
i hope no one sees me like this
look in the mirror
i just want to be free
nobody noticed the mistake
tom has already pledged to do that
it looks appetizing
when did you start studying latin
this explains everything
the students answered in order
i like to eat meat
i like clocks
this is so cool
that will never change
stand up please
we bought some tennis balls
he earns  yen a month
there is no way to confirm that he is alive
i can give it a try
this makes me mad
tom took one of the books off the shelf
los angeles is the second largest city in the united states
we see with our eyes
he has to deal with complaints
he lived and died in obscurity
is there time
he is not fond of sports and i am not either
i'm used to having my own way
i wanted to make a good first impression
i'm at a loss for words
the surface of the earth is  water
do you trust me
tom told mary he wanted a divorce
i have every reason to believe that he is innocent of the crime
how many times have you gone there
i know only this
i'm not rich
tom didn't get home until after midnight
tom spilled a cup of coffee all over his keyboard
the violence lasted for two weeks
i hope to go to canada next year
i refuse to be ignored any longer

i can do it myself
tom can't read any menu not written in english
at first i did not like rock music but now i do
which color do you prefer blue or green
i'm not always going to be there for you
he hasn't written them a letter in a long time
chew with your mouth closed

no one was ever able to solve the riddle
can you guess the worth of the diamond
education starts at home
tom lacks empathy
the temperature has suddenly dropped
he's a very hard worker

it was really cheap
i can't think of everything
would you like to eat lunch together
you deserve a present
i need to talk to you
give me a cigarette
why are you so worried
lack of sleep will make you do stupid things
why do they care
people will talk
i wouldn't want to work in a hospital
tom may be wrong
tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as mary before
he's a man we can trust
you can't stay in here all day
all i want is a washing machine
how does this work
a heavy rain fell
give me a chance to make you proud of me
people used to laugh at him behind his back
tom jumped into the cold water
may i try this on
he has a terrible hangover
all the houses were shaking and alarms were ringing everywhere
those answers are incorrect
who designed the white house
why didn't you phone before coming
tom didn't know how to answer mary's question
you're smart
tom and mary think i don't know who john is
i couldn't deny it
there is no telling what will happen
i'll phone you as soon as i get to the airport
he was completely worn out
i'm not going to make it on time

this is the camera that tom took the pictures with
my father builds bridges
tom did study but he didn't study very much

he wants to participate in the contest
tom is the one who showed me how to do it
thanks a lot for the advice

i live at akasaka in tokyo
tom saw mary
please wait for me
see you in three weeks
have you ever seen a film this good
what do you really love to do
tom goes to school on foot
she speaks a little arabic
he abandoned the plan
a man who smacks his wife around is contemptible
it was so noisy that i couldn't make myself heard
the idea was good
he's just an amateur
there's no need to advertise a good wine
he is always forgetting things
tom could hear his name being called
prague is very beautiful
i told you not to touch me
i'm not very good at making pizza but tom is
her grandmother lived to be eighty eight years old
so far everything has been going well
i know what tom is talking about

i ate dinner last night but i don't think tom did
he admitted that it was true
there must be a solution
he hasn't said a word
thank you for not smoking
tom is extremely clumsy
tom has short hair
i was born in osaka
don't make excuses

his ideas are based on his experience
what are we going to do next
that wasn't so long ago

i appreciate what you're trying to do
i'll send it to you

i am writing to inquire whether you have any positions available
i'd rather stay home than go out in this weather
that room is not very large
i had no idea that tom knew so much about zebras
i can't afford to eat in such an expensive restaurant
this is all wrong
tom is my student
she's innocent
i wouldn't have believed that if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes
the bridge collapsed
tom saw a ghost
she speaks english and german
i sold the car
all of us were busy cleaning the room
this vacuum cleaner makes a lot of noise

i'm not even canadian
yesterday my bicycle was stolen while i was doing some shopping
will you lend me your bicycle for an hour

i was tired so i didn't do that
do you have something that you want to say to me
when did you get to boston
tom is chatting with his friends
tom and his dog sleep in the same room
winter has gone spring has come
i just want you to know that i really love you
where is the nearest internet cafe
think about it
tom wasn't happy
i'm sure of his success
i'm not going to stay if you don't want me to
a good idea occurred to him
is that what people do
i need to make a phone call
this picture reminds me of when i was a student
i agree with that statement
tom asked if anyone had seen mary
i've kept the best for last
the children went out to play
you can go there directly by bus or by train
she is a wonderful woman
on election day voters chose nixon
tom helped us do that
tom is being hunted by the police
it has begun
the old castle lay in ruins
that's very big
hokkaido is to the north of honshu
it was really nice talking to you tom
my backyard can hold more than ten people
where do they come from
what does he plan to do
you lost
tom acted as if nothing had happened
he dropped the sausage on the ground
i don't need your job
tom said that he wanted to move to boston
i read the label
tom has been in boston for a week
now that you have made your decision you must act
french isn't easy for me
assuming your story is true what should i do
tom came to my office to ask me for money
did you put a stamp on the envelope
they were afraid
there's a hotel across the street
the leaves have all fallen
go with these men
i was eating dinner then
do you believe in eternal life after death
i have a feeling today is going to be interesting
those shoes won't do for climbing
i'll introduce you to a nice girl
i'm on my way to visit a friend in the hospital
tom felt disappointed
i've always loved you
ask her when she will come back
something's missing
he lends money at a high rate of interest
keep walking
tom leaned over to put on his shoes
tom found what he was looking for under the table
i'm sorry to interrupt you
the cat is waiting for you at home
tom doesn't have a lot of freedom
there were no railroads at that time in japan
it looks appetizing
he's three years older than my father
the sailors were at the mercy of the weather
i love rock musicians
i'd rather walk than take a bus
it's futile
this is my grandmother
tom told me he used to be married
will you help me take the suitcases down from the rack
what did you spill
you're going to do exactly as i tell you
they could be anywhere by now
tom reassured mary
spanish is her mother tongue
without honor victory is hollow
i really do want tom to be happy
the work must be finished before noon
tom is against smoking
i need to know what's happening
the lady dressed in white is a famous actress
he knows me well
he's getting up early
i'd buy it
today i met my new philosophy teacher
have you seen my watch
he will soon be able to swim well
i'm happy with the way things went
the united states has close ties to mexico
cuzco is one of the most interesting places in the world
i didn't order them
you had better ask him in advance how much it will cost
that's a good idea
the restaurant owner allowed her to take table scraps home to feed all of her dogs
the posters were immediately removed from the wall
there are many islands in greece
i hope the economy picks up soon
they struggled
this is suicide
tom can barely speak french
tom ignored mary all morning
tom asked me if i could help mary
japan's changing economic policy is tied up with the labor shortage
i will never violate a law again
are you on a diet
find out what the problem is
would you care for my plants while i'm away
could you loan money to my brother
what you see above the water is just the tip of the iceberg
they aren't quarreling but are rehearsing a play
the sum of two plus three plus four is nine
he ended his life by jumping off a bridge
it's great that you got the promotion
some people take a bath every day and others don't
tom came all the way from boston
i like mahjong
the board is about two meters long
do you want a demonstration
tom raised his hand
he reached for the apple
no matter what we do tom won't be satisfied
you're finished already
there are various reasons why a house may be left vacant
it's extremely dangerous
we understand that
cows give us milk
you can use my computer if you want
have you washed your hands yet
i can't believe it
i'm going to get ready for the final exams this afternoon
the new car is hers
when the big earthquake occurred i was just ten
tom must be angry with mary
i wanted to introduce you to tom
he was wrong in thinking that she'd come to see him
how is tom
tom is mary's ex
no one would say that
those houses are big
i know you'll agree with me
i'll call you if i hear anything
he lives there alone
just as the americans like baseball the british like cricket
he could run fast when he was young
i won't be here long
mary is now a happy little girl
your watch is on the desk
there were  more births than deaths in the town last month
this is easy
i can't exclude it
you read my mind
he beat the dog with a stick
he had the cheek to ask me to help him
don't take things so seriously
has the jury reached a verdict
remain seated please
the prophecy came true
hi guys

tom's parents told him not to get involved with mary
he caught a boy stealing his watch
you must do as you are told
this land is your land
this dress fits me very well
tom watches too much television
you have made a promise
everybody expected that the experiment would result in failure
i'm single again
ask tom
i don't know whether i'll go or not
you need to shut up
she seems rich
i want to be with tom
she has been sick for three weeks
maybe it'll work
hand me the remote
life is very hard
are you going to the theater tonight
he was humiliated by her
that's what i want
take an umbrella with you in case it rains
ski jumping looks scary
she's the french ambassador to portugal
tom is passed out in bed
some men shave their legs
don't tell anyone what i just said
i'm not sure who paid the bill
i meant it as a joke
i didn't notice the light turn red
he placed the book on the shelf
there are no exceptions to this rule
tom bit me
that's me
did you see the solar eclipse yesterday
do you know how to use this camera
to some extent i agree with you
please turn on the radio

i think about him all the time
that's convenient isn't it
do you have any idea how much this cost me
it's the most beautiful thing i've ever seen
tom didn't want mary to work
you've earned a good rest
your shoes are here where are mine

how often do you eat fish
he has been playing tennis since this morning
there's fruit and meat in this market
i met him by chance on the train this morning
i owe ten dollars to her
what a good scholar the author must be to write such a splendid book
it's getting worse and worse
look closely
unfortunately it's raining today
it tears me up inside
i liked walking alone on the deserted beach
every ship needs an anchor
we try
they are about the same age
i want mine
let's do that
how dare you laugh at me
i wish i could have spoken french

i used to play the trombone
i have two daughters and two sons
i was at the reception
i just smiled
that wasn't my mistake
help me and i'll help you
you have to judge the case without bias
we need to find an effective method
i know that's not true
do you know what tom's secret is
we're trying
i persuaded him to take part in it
we just want you to be happy
tom seldom eats seafood
did you read the editorial i wrote for the newspaper
give me a couple more hours
we weren't doing anything
tom thinks mary may have an eating disorder
i like both watching and playing sports
can i use my credit card
cut the chit chat and get to work
what a fool i was to lend him the money
tom says it hurts
i'm looking forward to it
tom got bored and left
has it stopped snowing
you have my support
i think you're making a mistake
the next time i tell you to do something do it
i cut my little finger peeling potatoes
let's not watch tv
in conversation one is likely to find out certain things about the other person quite easily
the baby is playing with some toys
we just gave up too soon
tom knows how to fight
are you coming
that's a relief
tom doesn't like mary
family is family
take command
how do you console a woman who has just lost her only child
please keep me informed
this is how we make ice cream
write your goals down on a sheet of paper
save your breath
we drove across the city
tom started dreaming
it's a risk we have to take
it is dangerous to drink too much
her pregnancy was fraught with complications
i'm going to join the school orchestra
i went to the hospital to see my mother
tom hasn't said a thing all day
tom doesn't understand how that could have happened

the gun isn't loaded
please adjust the seat to fit you

i'm going to be a father soon
it's their right
i have to set an example
tom certainly was a nice guy
watch him and do what he does
he fell in love with a younger woman
which do you like better the sea or the mountains
tom kissed mary on the cheek and then got into his car
i want to go to australia once again before my passport expires
i'm only trying to help
you're a lucky girl
i like neither of them

tom never lends money to anyone
my friend was arrested for speeding
hold this ladder steady
you can see some wild rabbits in the forest
i'll try to get in touch with tom
tom and john are brothers
you're tough
where are you going
how old were you when the war broke out
nothing really matters
i have good news for you
i still dream about it
tom will go there tomorrow
it depends largely on the context
that child has a very large head
no one was in the swimming pool
what you did is immoral
i felt sorry for her when i heard her story
he told her that she was right
i couldn't remember the title of that song

tom changed his mind
my great grandmother was a dressmaker
tom left mary alone with john
turn on the tv
i learned a lot about boston
tom is unmarried
tom looked around the room for his keys
i should get back to my seat
tom doesn't have to tell me i already know
don't laugh at him
i'd like to tell you the truth
tom shot himself in the head
nobody can stop tom
i have more time and less money than ever
they missed a lot
we're all canadians
if i were a rich man i would buy you a diamond ring
i'll take these roses
i left my bag here
i quit
who drew it
school begins at nine and is over at six
does love exist
she began to cry as soon as she left the room
strictly speaking there were some mistakes in his speech
tom made a sandwich for mary
i am not older than he is
that sounds fair
i am not always at home on sundays
these clothes are dirty and need to be washed
there are forty students in our class
i'd rather not eat this
i'm going to take a look
tom hasn't been busy for three days
tom likes watching tv in the evening
do you want to drink coffee
i should've left my camera at home
tom was scared of me
has tom gone insane
this is a beautiful story

i wish i'd bought a white dress
tom was hurt
look at that
follow your dreams
some people see a conspiracy behind almost everything
the mid term exams are just around the corner
i'm used to staying up late at night
what's the secret to success

i can't help thinking of the future
it took them some time to get used to each other
nobody recognizes me
do you like juice
are you through with your homework
i usually toss my loose change into my desk drawer
she had a basket full of apples
tom opened a window
there's nothing i can do about it
that old man is a fussy eater
we were caught in a shower on the way to school
i'd do anything for you
seize him
don't raise your voice at me
she donated countless pieces to the museum
i'm going home now
the place is almost deserted
that's her
this game can be played by young children
i really need a drink now
which instruments do you play
tom didn't like not having enough money
he was listening to music in his room
how did tom find out
tom has been trying to get a loan from a bank
you don't even know my name
my time is very expensive
tom couldn't stop coughing
he can run fast
aside from that is there anything else you want
they didn't win did they
tom is one of our former clients
how much longer will it take for the tub to fill
this is your last chance to spend time with tom
the market is glutted with cheap imports
are you insane
when do you usually get up
i always think of my father when i look at this picture
do you know him
i like grapes but i can't eat so many
mary decided not to keep the dress she had bought
i'm sorry i dropped my knife
today isn't my day
he is the owner of this land
he stayed up all night reading a novel
he smiled at us and got on the train
this is by far the best way
please just leave me alone i want to think
the fire started in tom's room
put on this sweater
this beer contains  alcohol
tom went backstage to see if he could meet some of the band members
some italian fashion designers are saying that white bathing suits will catch on this year
tom is very dependable isn't he
that car is mine
we need a bit more time to prepare
he's in danger
i'm mary's boyfriend
i'm not here to arrest you
classes begin on monday
i thought tom was one of them
i don't like telling him the truth
i was with tom all day
you're always complaining
i don't know where i should go
tom picked up the bottle but had trouble opening it
don't forget about me
the room has two windows
tom put an engagement ring on mary's finger
tom has never been married
tom was offended by what mary said
he admits being involved in the scandal
i would never try that
i can read french
i don't have enough money to buy another house
i've always dated older women
we're all teachers here
is it difficult to learn french
we're going home by car
what time do you have dinner
i bought that car
he asked for some money
i'm happy to be here
let's go and sit in the shade
the worst part is it wasn't always like this
she bears an uncanny resemblance to marilyn monroe
how are the children
i am fat
he has lost his father's watch
what's your favorite symphony
this spoon is for tea
is that your room
tom can't even read
he is afraid of his father
she goes to the supermarket every three days
he'll get there in ten hours
this is so typical
keep it up
i know what they said
i need more blankets
are you still in love with tom
it was difficult to keep up the conversation
come with us
i have no money
i like this house as it is
i belong to the music club
i saw what you did
not everything in this world is measured in money
the neighbor didn't see anything
i never agree with him
eventually his rights had to be acknowledged
how is the weather
it is cheaper than chemical fertilizers
i thought you'd probably already gone home
tom can't be stopped
do you know where tom was hiding
tom always shouts when he is angry
take this folding umbrella with you it might come in handy
the birds flew away in alarm when they saw the cat
he doesn't watch tv at all
i have no idea what i'm talking about
i burned my hand with an iron
i don't think there is a doctor here
i need to go feed the chickens
good luck with that tom
tom isn't answering his cell
he must be crazy to say such a thing
have you tried it
i don't want any more
i took over the business from my father
i don't think tom is listening
go away
you should read this
what time will the band start playing
could you pass me the salt please
you promised
they took tom to the hospital to have his stomach pumped because he ate something poisonous
it's the least we can do
some people like the sea more others like the mountains more
he's my husband
tom sat two rows ahead of me
tom was very tired
do you really believe in that stuff
she has a small black dog
i made a deal
i'd like to know for sure
the heat is terrible today
they're old
tom hasn't yet done what we've asked him to do
i like going for a walk in the park
tom shouldn't have stolen mary's money
i'm meditating
why do you want to talk to tom
he doesn't talk to me anymore
how good is he
i'm a priest
we entered the room by the back door
tom became tired of always having to pay the bill every time he went out with mary
tom died from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head
tom can eat just about anything but peanuts
how many rooms do you have
mary lied to her husband
the hail cracked the window
none of your business
where's that movie showing
i won't ever be allowed to do that
the meeting is just about done
he did splendidly in the examination
i do everything for my family
don't you get bored when you're alone
i still don't see anything
i meant no harm
i had a phone call from him
that's a beautiful necklace
i hope everyone knows what this means
ten years is a long time
tom is in boston
please say yes
he doesn't speak my language
there are a few shops next to my house
did tom bribe mary
i don't recommend eating in that restaurant the food is awful
if that is not true she is a liar
she sleeps with two pillows
i thought tom wasn't allowed to eat candy
i have to plan everything
mary pretended she was her older sister
i see the queen
do you have medical insurance
i forgot to take my medicine this morning
thank you kindly
tom needs our input
tom has secretly been contacting mary
i'm not working today
prices will continue to rise
even though he was tired he worked
elvis presley is one of the most famous singers
i plan to go to the movies
we're pooped
they left him for dead
he gave me an orange in exchange for a piece of cake
they've gone
they aren't my real parents
do you want to sell them
see you tomorrow at the office
where's his book it's on the table
people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
he went far away
do you live near here
it was a dangerous time
she stayed here by herself
i paid her five dollars
i never visit my sister
i'll be with you in ten minutes
tom's dream is to live in the mountains
someone pushed me inside
this box weighs a ton what's inside
call me later
i'd like to know more about boston
tom's got nothing to lose
make sure that the dog does not escape
come over here
tom's heart suddenly began to beat faster
i want to know who told you that
we're going to invite tom and mary to our halloween party
my father has already given up smoking and drinking
please tell tom mary called
that will do
that child is only four but he can already count to 
is there anybody in there
are there still some empty seats
i'm not as talkative as you
the teacher let the boy go home
at the most you'll only be  minutes late
does that mean you bought it
i'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find another place to live
i have no ear for music
some children are playing on the grass
we rented a cabin by a lake
i was here first
do you want to tell me about it now
they ate up all the cake
tom finally got a job
how long are you going to stay here
the rain lasted five days
i raised my hand to ask a question
he was regarded as a hero for saving his friend's life
i don't want to start anything i can't finish
they're back
he finished drinking one beer and ordered another
let's discuss that problem later
i'm yours
that book is very old
tom shouldn't say things like that to mary
i could be wrong
this is good isn't it
tom accidentally set fire to the curtain
why didn't tom tell mary
tom is a good athlete
my field of study is linguistics
tom plays the bass guitar in our band
tom didn't deny it
tom tends to exaggerate
tom listened to mary singing
not everybody wants to be an artist
have courage
i neither drink nor smoke
it could get worse
they made many changes
visiting tom was a good idea
the new library has been under construction since last year
i haven't done that
they must come here at once
go to your room now
tom couldn't help smiling
when was the last time you washed the car
i've got exactly  dollars in my pocket
say what you want to say
the mountains are beautiful
my mother makes the best cakes in the world
can you guarantee that
tom is good at swimming
do you still want to go to the zoo on monday
it's hard to choose
i was petrified
people sometimes compare death to sleep
that kind of thing can't be found just anywhere
she cremated him within  hours of his death
it won't stop raining
tom used to be drunk by this time every night
tom admitted that he was wrong
tom laughed out loud when he saw mary's outfit
tom wants you to take us to school
i'm intrigued by tom's idea
i've had enough of tom and mary
he told me the truth

those hungarian girls are very pretty
don't admit anything
he told me to be kind to others
the problem is that i don't have enough money
i went to school with your dad
i don't think this is funny
what seems easy at first often turns out to be difficult
wasn't he your boyfriend
mary protected her husband
i'm sure that was helpful
we ate until we couldn't eat any more

they say that he is the richest person in the world
the ship sank to the bottom of the sea
shall i close the door

no one was aware of her literary talent
she is wearing a brooch
our teacher is a real idiot

the number of europeans who visit thailand every year is very large

those are nice
tom has a message for mary
let me know what you want to do
tom was obsessed by the belief that one by one everyone around him was being abducted and replaced by aliens
i like languages
i hate the world because the world hates me
i'm sorry i yelled at you
he has started acting strangely
tornadoes are very destructive
i wonder why we play tennis in miniskirts
tom certainly didn't sound alarmed
he is having lunch
tom is rich and powerful
i went back to my seat
when does the post office open
the old couple had no children
i know lots of songs

they ate supper
he likes both music and sports
i can't protect tom
they abandoned the fort to the enemy
i came to japan from china
you should obey your parents
don't tell on me
tom has been to this park with mary at least a dozen times
they meant well
what's wrong
that's tom's book
we're losing time
it is difficult to talk to him
he can't stay long
is that all tom told you
i'm afraid i have to go now
this is our last chance
i think i'll come back soon

you had better have your eyes examined
excuse me but i didn't order this

you're still smiling
no one is allowed to leave this building
tom bowed and withdrew
they gave him a chance to escape
he asked me for help
i'm pretty tense right now
we spent a quiet day in the country
i'd like to hear exactly how tom managed to get that old car running again
tom has no idea where mary lives
tom says he can't walk another step
it's monday that i'll do that
she crossed the street
i helped my father water the flowers
tom didn't know that mary had decided to quit her job
tell me the name of the ninth month
he borrowed money from the bank to finance his home
are you going to play tricks on me again you naughty boy
we were made to stay in a small room
why would tom want to kill mary
the problem is that that boy never does what he is told to do
this rose is beautiful
where did you buy that book
she wanted to get a divorce
this bread is very delicious
they supplied the war victims with food

tom nodded in agreement
i am thankful for vacations
tom felt the urge to run away
they're yours tom

he pretended to be a doctor
we're not as stupid as you thought right
i like the way you smile
do you want to try it
this cd belongs to my son
i'm at work now
tom is my prisoner
i don't like the way she speaks
how's tom
her look expressed her joy
he kicked it
tom released mary
i have some gifts
my parents are in australia
although tom is sick he plans to get his homework done on time
tom brought a gift for mary
who paid you
i know they'll all want to help you
if you really like mary you should ask her out
i have no money
i grew up doing this
the lecture was really boring
tom usually puts mustard and ketchup on his hot dogs
tom's son was killed in a traffic accident last winter
your face is familiar to me
tom followed in his father's footsteps and became a lawyer
life goes on
please simmer the beans for a while over a low heat
i'm sorry i was so rude
can you hear me
i love to spend time trying to put together a puzzle
you should free those animals from the cage
tom is the real problem
did you wash your hands
i wish to go to paris to study art
sit down
he is devoid of human feeling
would you like to eat lunch together
the more you eat the fatter you'll get
could you make room for me
tom wanted me to lie
everybody but tom was present
i just took a shower
let's wait and see how things go
i think you should tell tom that
tom knows
describe your ideal breakfast
tom threw the apple core into the garbage can
half of the melon was eaten
they waited for their teacher
that just goes to prove that you are a liar
dinosaurs once ruled the earth
it's just a matter of time before tom gets into trouble again

that's really sad
i don't like studying
it's almost midnight go to bed
i volunteered
he couldn't help laughing at it
you know we didn't do this
it's deserted
when she returned to her room the diamond ring was gone
who else have you asked
it is not good for you to break your promise
were you able to do that by yourself
i'm contemplating this option
i've been studying french for a long time but i'm not fluent
that's my line
mary played the role of an old woman in the play
the religious man remained kneeling for hours
father told me to wash the car
i have absolutely nothing to do
we aren't alone
there's something there
tom wanted to help mary do the right thing
do you have any french speaking employees
i've been thinking about you too

mary can cook anything without using a recipe
one of my dreams is to learn icelandic
she has a lot of money
she is fond of singing old songs

i tried to break the door open which i found impossible
when did you see my scar
we have just a tiny bit of garden
i'm in trouble i need your help
he was patient
let's start with something simple
tom pretended he didn't see mary do what she did
i confess my name's not really tom
i can't help
slander is a crime
can i get you a coffee
tom will be able to answer your question
can you explain it to me
what do you like to do when it's hot
he makes good use of his talents
violence breeds more violence
why haven't you called
i love tapioca pudding
what a hassle
i like stories
how much should i pay
what do you intend to do
tom doesn't know what else to do
all of us live in the same neighborhood
i have a friend whose father is an animal doctor
this coat is too short on me
this spoils all my plans
she was there in the morning
tom isn't actually a student anymore
i was very nervous as the plane took off
i made that one
i was very young when that happened

the tv remote control is under the couch
i have to choose between these two
he had a mild heart attack
i want to ask you some questions about tom
i have one question for you
they came back
i read the book from beginning to end
how large was it
it isn't fair
if i tell him the truth she will never forgive me
will you live in sasayama next year

it is a book
tom didn't mean to be so late
i'm proud to be canadian
when was the last time you combed your hair
they were prohibited from leaving the hotel
tom got tired of waiting for mary
tom left everything to me
you're an idiot
i truly doubt it
the train had already left when we got to station

the situation changed the following year
it's fun to learn a foreign language
i don't really need another car
you have many friends
i make it a rule not to watch television after nine o'clock
mary put some flowers in the vase and then put the vase on the table
don't disturb me
i'm looking for an old man
for my part i have no objection
i rescued her
drug addiction is a cancer in modern society
when the curtain went up the stage was dark
what might happen
tom could tell mary was interested
i have a tourist visa
i'll never tell anyone who you really are
just give me a minute
i thought you were dead
she achieved her goal
the kidnappers gagged tom and locked him up in a closet
this sounds like french
why did you buy this kind of car
i can't count the number of times tom has complained about that
you should know it
tom was very proud of you
tom opened the door and asked mary if she was busy
please open this box
can i see tom a moment
i'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes
who told you i was going to the beach today
i haven't been able to go to school for a week
walk this way
i don't want to know their names
they released a new album
i've got mosquito bites all over my arm
i assumed that tom and mary were husband and wife
tom tried to stay calm
come on hang in there
have you made a decision yet
that's not what you said
pass me the salt and pepper please
we all like cycling
i'm too old for this
i didn't tell you everything
what's that crunching sound
where have you been all this time
i don't have to wear glasses any more
tom decided to major in french
the meeting in short was a waste of time

i've been struggling for years now
i'd like to be alone for a few minutes please
when did you learn to swim
tom read the document out loud
i feel stupid sometimes
i bought a leather frame for the picture
i think tom is too young to retire
it is true that she teaches french at school
i've never been to europe
that almost happened to us too
either you or i am right
a cat is not human
we're becoming too conceited
i can fly
tom noticed mary was looking at john
i had trouble deciding which brand of dog food to feed my dog
i loved you
tom looks like he's too tired to help us right now
tom and mary have one daughter and two sons
put it there
mary likes japan doesn't she
wait until tomorrow
we can meet
this car isn't worth repairing
people should understand that the world is changing
i had already eaten before i arrived at the party
i'd like to run a few more tests
health is essential to happiness
what are you suggesting
is she afraid of death
i'm no longer worried
all of the books are good but none as good as this one
let's do it when he comes
i think i'll be able to deal with that
that's a good question
i don't believe you just said that
quiet please
she will care for you from now on
is it that late
she said to herself i am very happy
one of my friends can speak french fairly well
you have only to wait for her return
i didn't know that dogs swim well

he is now almost as tall as his father is
i love french
you look very beautiful
tom is just a boy
how many floors does this building have
they're very dangerous
that street is very noisy
tom wasn't very ambitious

why did you invite tom to dinner
i bought a house
mary hasn't watered her flowers yet
someone came
someday she'll have to pay for what she's done
tom did neither of the two things i asked him to do
mary mixed the ingredients to make a cake
i phoned
they've gone
when is the rent due
only members of the club are entitled to use this room
you're not welcome here
tom is quite conceited

he came home right at ten
he couldn't overcome the desire for another cigarette
the tea we had there was excellent
i can't help you if you don't trust me
he is trying hard to give up smoking
tom took off his shoes
tom didn't understand anything
tom did it on his own
the old man sat surrounded by the children
the traffic light changed to red
leave while you can
we have to analyze that
it is like looking for a needle in a haystack
let's wait until it stops raining
i'll get a cab
even tom is surprised that mary lied
the men are wearing short sleeves
i love weddings
are they students
you're the only one who bought it
let's not get into that please
are you cooking tonight
tom doesn't like any kind of spicy food
i like this
my alarm clock didn't go off this morning
i have to wash the dishes
tom prayed
i guess i was too busy to notice that tom was having problems
i'm pretty much done
i already have a family
i don't want to see you
she is very free with her money
smoking is harmful to the health
three times five is fifteen
i hate going to girls' birthday parties i never know what to get them
i was looking for something
try not to worry
there are many many planets in the milky way which are just as big as jupiter

my car broke down this morning and won't be repaired until friday
four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed
he was my only friend
tom didn't make it to the station on time
i can get a gun for you within five hours

i'm worth more than this
don't worry it's a very common mistake
can you pay attention
tom said you needed a haircut
languages are subject to constant change
you look gloomy
i have work to do now
tom wouldn't abandon mary
to tell the truth i didn't go there

tom used to hate boston
i ran into the classroom out of breath
monday was so hectic
i don't believe atlantis ever existed
i did nothing during the holidays
i think i've made a big mistake
she didn't press him for an explanation
nobody wanted to believe tom

he described what had happened in detail
as you sow so will you reap
mr mailer will stay here until tomorrow
